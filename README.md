# customer-sentiment-analysis


This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze product reviews, aiming to extract valuable insights for businesses. It begins by preprocessing the text, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words to ensure data cleanliness and consistency. Subsequently, the code identifies key aspects mentioned in the reviews, such as product features or attributes, and evaluates the sentiments associated with each aspect. By generating summaries for each review and determining the overall sentiment, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of customer opinions and preferences.

Utilizing NLTK and SpaCy libraries, the code demonstrates proficiency in various NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, aspect extraction, opinion identification, and text summarization. These skills enable businesses to automate the analysis of large volumes of textual data, facilitating informed decision-making and targeted improvements to products or services. By uncovering patterns and sentiments within customer feedback, organizations can optimize their strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

Overall, this project showcases the power of NLP techniques in extracting actionable insights from unstructured text data. By understanding customer sentiments and preferences expressed in reviews, businesses can refine their products, tailor marketing strategies, and ultimately foster stronger relationships with their target audience.
